    <h2>Understanding Coffee Beans</h2>

    <h2>Essential Brewing Equipment</h2>
    <p>Different coffee brewing methods require specific equipment. From simple pour-over setups to elaborate espresso machines, choosing the right coffee gear depends on your taste preferences, budget, and daily coffee consumption habits.</p>
