    <h1>History of Hyderabadi Biryani</h1>
    
    <p>Hyderabadi biryani has a rich history dating back to the Mughal era. This traditional dish originated in the royal kitchens of Hyderabad.</p>
    
    <p>The unique dum cooking method makes Hyderabadi biryani special. Rice and meat are cooked separately, then layered and slow-cooked in a sealed pot.</p>
    
    <p>Different types include chicken biryani, mutton biryani, and vegetable biryani. Each has its own preparation style and spice blend.</p>

    <p>Modern biryani restaurants try to recreate the authentic taste, but home-cooked biryani remains the gold standard.</p>
