    <h1>Your First Step into Fitness</h1>
    
    <p>Welcome to your comprehensive guide to starting a fitness journey. Whether you're new to exercise or returning after a break, this guide will help you build a sustainable workout routine.</p>
    
    <h2>Getting Started with Exercise</h2>
    <p>Beginning a fitness routine doesn't have to be intimidating. Start with basic cardio exercises like walking or light jogging, then gradually incorporate strength training into your weekly routine. The key is consistency, not intensity.</p>
    
    <h2>Building Your Home Gym</h2>
    <p>You don't need an expensive gym membership to get a great workout. With just a few basic pieces of equipment, you can create an effective exercise routine at home. Focus on functional movements that work multiple muscle groups.</p>
    
    <h2>Cardio Fundamentals</h2>
    <p>Cardiovascular exercise is essential for heart health and overall fitness. Start with 20-30 minutes of moderate cardio activity three times per week. As your fitness level improves, you can increase duration and intensity.</p>
    
    <h2>Strength Training Basics</h2>
    <p>Strength training is crucial for building muscle, improving bone density, and boosting metabolism. Begin with bodyweight exercises before progressing to weights. Focus on proper form rather than heavy weights when starting your workout journey.</p>
    
    <h2>Creating a Sustainable Routine</h2>
    <p>The best exercise program is one you can stick to long-term. Start with 3-4 workout sessions per week, mixing cardio and strength training. Listen to your body and allow adequate recovery time between intense gym sessions.</p>
    
    <p>Remember, fitness is a lifelong journey. Start where you are, be consistent, and celebrate your progress along the way!</p>
