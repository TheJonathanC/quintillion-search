    <h1>Travel the World on a Budget</h1>
    
    <p>Travel doesn't have to break the bank! With smart planning and insider knowledge, you can explore incredible destinations while keeping costs low. Budget travel is about maximizing experiences, not minimizing adventures.</p>
    
    <h2>Finding Cheap Flights</h2>
    <p>Flight costs often represent the largest expense in travel budgets. Use flexible date searches, consider alternative airports, and book during off-peak times to save money. Travel deal websites and airline newsletters can alert you to special promotions.</p>
    
    <h2>Accommodation Strategies</h2>
    <p>Traditional hotels aren't your only option for travel accommodation. Hostels, homestays, house-sitting, and vacation rentals often provide better value and more authentic travel experiences than expensive hotel chains.</p>
    
    <h2>Local Transportation</h2>
    <p>Public transportation, walking, and cycling are not only budget-friendly travel options but also offer authentic ways to explore destinations. Many cities offer tourist transport passes that provide unlimited travel at discounted rates.</p>
    
    <h2>Eating Like a Local</h2>
    <p>Street food and local markets offer delicious meals at fraction of restaurant prices. This approach to travel dining also provides cultural insights and authentic flavors you won't find in touristy establishments.</p>
    
    <h2>Free Activities and Attractions</h2>
    <p>Every destination offers free or low-cost activities. Museums often have free days, parks provide natural entertainment, and walking tours showcase local history. Research free travel activities before your trip to maximize your budget.</p>
    
    <p>Remember, the best travel memories often come from unexpected experiences, not expensive attractions. Embrace spontaneity and local recommendations!</p>
